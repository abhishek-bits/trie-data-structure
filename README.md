# Trie Data Structure

Implementation of Trie Data Structure in Java.

## About

- Trie is an N-ary tree, where each node in the tree is itself a structure representing TrieNode.

- Trie is a string matching data structure which is better than any dictionary based string storage such that, it provides faster search-time to search for any given prefix.

## Implementation

- [Array based implementation](https://github.com/abhishek-bits/trie-data-structure/blob/master/src/trie/TrieUsingArray.java)

- [HashMap based implementation](https://github.com/abhishek-bits/trie-data-structure/blob/master/src/trie/TrieUsingHashMap.java)
